//! Write the static app shell to `dist/` while the crate compiles.
//!
//! Life Counter is a browser application, so publishing it is a file copy, not a
//! program run. Of the eight shell files, `app.js` and `app_bg.wasm` come from
//! `wasm-bindgen` and belong to that step alone. This script owns the other
//! six:
//!
//! * `index.html` is `src/ui.html`, byte for byte.
//! * `service-worker.js` is `src/service-worker.js` with `__VERSION__`
//!   substituted for a cache name derived from the bytes of every *other* file
//!   in `dist/`. Deriving it here rather than per request is what makes the
//!   cache name change exactly when the site does.
//! * `icon.svg` is `assets/icon.svg`, byte for byte: the shell links it
//!   directly and the service worker caches it, so the file that ships is the
//!   committed one.
//! * `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` are rasterized from that same SVG,
//!   which stays the source of truth and is never replaced by them.
//! * `manifest.webmanifest` is assembled here rather than committed, so its icon
//!   list cannot drift from what was actually rasterized.
//!
//! Everything lands in `dist/`, which is the whole site and the only copy, so
//! `cargo build --release` leaves a publishable site behind and there is no
//! `cargo run` step and no server.
