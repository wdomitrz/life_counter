//! The browser application: draw the board, and turn pointers into calls on
//! [`crate::counter`].
//!
//! JavaScript in this app is the generated wasm-bindgen platform glue, the
//! ~6-line loader in `ui.html` and the service worker. There is no handwritten
//! application script and no pointer ABI: a `PointerEvent` is received here,
//! where its `client_x` is read once, and only the player's index and the sign
//! cross into the domain layer.
//!
//! Two timers replace the original's `setTimeout` calls, and both are driven
//! from one interval: one to mature a long press, and one to expire a snackbar.
//! Rust owns them, so a game in progress cannot leak a timer it forgot about,
//! and both stop the moment the round resets.
