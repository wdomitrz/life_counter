//! The rules of the game, with no DOM in sight.
//!
//! This is the whole application: a life total per player, a long press that
//! replaces the tap it would otherwise become, a snackbar that sums recent
//! changes, a grid layout, and the rotation rule that turns the bottom half of
//! the board upside down so a table of players can all read their own number.
//!
//! Every decision here is a pure function or a small state machine driven by
//! timestamps, which is what makes the app testable without a browser. The
//! clock is a parameter rather than a call to [`std::time::Instant`], so a test
//! can step time forward exactly as far as it wants to and assert on the
//! boundary: 499 ms of press is still a tap, 500 ms is already a long press, a
//! change 2999 ms after the last one joins the running total and one at 3000 ms
//! starts a new one.
