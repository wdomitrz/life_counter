//! Invariants of the committed sources, and of what is and is not committed.
//!
//! Everything here reads committed files. `dist/` is build output and is
//! gitignored, so the release gate — which exports the candidate tree — never
//! has it, and cannot build it either: that needs the wasm target and a pinned
//! `wasm-bindgen` CLI. A test asserting on `dist/` would therefore run only in
//! a developer's checkout, which is exactly where it is least likely to catch
//! anything, so those assertions are gone rather than skipped.
//!
//! What covers the built output is running the two build steps, in the order
//! `AGENTS.md` gives them, and inspecting the eight files that come out. A test
//! on a leftover directory cannot do that job.
//!
//! What *is* worth pinning here is the set of rules that let the rewrite rot:
//! a second, dead JavaScript PWA creeping back into the tree, a build artefact
//! becoming tracked, or the page growing a hand-written wasm ABI. All three have
//! happened to this project or its siblings, and none of them is caught by the
//! domain unit tests.
